/**
 *  is an abstract generalization
 *             for all data types (1) whose value set has an order
 *             relation (less-or-equal) and (2) where difference is
 *             defined in all of the data type's totally ordered value
 *             subsets.  The quantity type abstraction is needed in
 *             defining certain other types, such as the interval and
 *             the probability distribution.
