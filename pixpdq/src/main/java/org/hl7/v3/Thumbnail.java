/**
 * 
 *                      A thumbnail is an abbreviated rendition of the full
 *                      data. A thumbnail requires significantly fewer
 *                      resources than the full data, while still maintaining
 *                      some distinctive similarity with the full data. A
 *                      thumbnail is typically used with by-reference
 *                      encapsulated data. It allows a user to select data
 *                      more efficiently before actually downloading through
 *                      the reference.
 *
