/**

 *             Fractional numbers. Typically used whenever quantities
 *             are measured, estimated, or computed from other real
 *             numbers.  The typical representation is decimal, where
 *             the number of significant decimal digits is known as the
 *             precision. Real numbers are needed beyond integers
 *             whenever quantities of the real world are measured,
 *             estimated, or computed from other real numbers. The term
 *             "Real number" in this specification is used to mean
 *             that fractional values are covered without necessarily
 *             implying the full set of the mathematical real numbers.
